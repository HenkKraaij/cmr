/**
 * \brief Tests a char matrix for graphicness.
 *
 * Returns \c true if and only if \p matrix is graphic.
 *
 * If \p pgraph is not \c NULL and if \p matrix is graphic, then \c *pgraph will point to a graph
 * representing \p matrix, and it is set to \c NULL otherwise.
 * If in addition to \p pgraph also \pbasis is not \c NULL, then this will be an array of edges
 * forming the basis, i.e., indexing the rows of the matrix.
 *
 * If \p submatrix is not \c NULL and the matrix is not graphic, then a minimal nongraphic submatrix
 * will be searched, which may cause extra computational effort. In this case, \c *submatrix will
 * point to this submatrix for which the caller must use \ref TUsubmatrixFree to free memory.
 * It is set to \c NULL otherwise.
