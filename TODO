=== Enumeration ===

By now we do a full enumeration of the first minor with >= 7 elements.
But it is sufficient to consider only those with |T_1| <= |T_2|.

Do we have to enumerate along the full sequence? According to video
of Truemper's talk we can stop when minors are not (co)graphic anymore.

=== Violator Search ===

After finding that row 0 leads to t.u.,
do not try to remove row 0 in next iteration (i.e. after removing something else)

Try to achieve square matrices to be able to calculate determinant for short cut.
