=== Finding a violated submatrix ===

Improvement of minor-backtracking. By now we just collect the pivot rows and columns
and take a union with the index set of the irregular matroid. It might be correct
to *replace* elements according to the pivot series instead of just collecting.

=== Full enumeration ===

By now we do a full enumeration of the first minor with >= 7 elements.
But it is sufficient to consider only those with |T_1| <= |T_2|.
