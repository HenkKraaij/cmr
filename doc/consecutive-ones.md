# Consecutive Ones # {#consecutive-ones}

A matrix \f$ M \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ has the **consecutive ones property for columns** if there is a permutation of the columns such that the permuted matrix \f$ M' \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ has the \f$ 1 \f$'s of each row consecutive.
Similarly, \f$ M \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ has the **consecutive ones property for rows** if \f$ M^{\mathsf{T}} \f$ has the consecutive ones property for columns.
