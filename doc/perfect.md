# Perfect Matrices # {#perfect}

A matrix \f$ M \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ is called **perfect** if it is the clique-node incidence matrix of a [perfect graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_graph).
In [A Characterization of Perfect Matrices](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-0208(08)72932-3) by Manfred W. Padberg (North-Holland Mathematics Studies, 1984) a characterization in terms of forbidden submatrices is provided.
