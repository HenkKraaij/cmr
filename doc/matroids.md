# Representation of Matroids # {#matroids}

The matroid **represented** by a matrix \f$ M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n} \f$ has \f$ m + n \f$ elements that correspond to the columns of \f$ [ \mathbb{I} \mid M ] \f$.
A subset of these columns is independent if and only if it is linearly independent over the field \f$ \mathbb{F} \f$.
