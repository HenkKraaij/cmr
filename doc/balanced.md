# Balanced / Balanceable Matrices # {#balanced}

A ternary matrix \f$ M \in \{-1,0,+1\}^{m \times n} \f$ is called **balanced** if it does not contain a square submatrix with two nonzero entries per row and per column in which the sum of all entries is 2 modulo 4.
A binary matrix \f$ M \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ is called **balanceable** if and its nonzero entries can be signed so that the resulting matrix is balanced.
