# Instance Generators # {#generators}

The library comes with several instance generators.
However, they are disabled for compilation by default, and can be enabled by adding

    -DGENERATORS=on

to the cmake call.
In the following we provide details for each of these generators.

## Graphic Matrices ##

The executable `cmr-generate-graphic` creates a random \f$ m \f$-by-\f$n\f$ matrix that is graphic.
To this end, it first constructs a spanning tree with \f$ m+1 \f$ nodes by subsequently connecting each new leaf to one of the previously created nodes.
The new edge then indexes a row of the matrix.
Second, \f$ n \f$ random pairs of distinct nodes are generated that are then connected by a new edge indexed by a column.
The matrix is the representation matrix of the final graph with respect to the spanning tree.
It can be called as follows, where \f$ m \f$ equals ROWS and \f$ n \f$ equals COLS.

    ./cmr-generate-graphic [OPTIONS] ROWS COLS

Options:
  - `-B NUM`    Benchmarks the recognition algorithm for the created matrix with NUM repetitions.
  - `-o FORMAT` Format of output FILE; default: `dense`.

Formats for matrices are \ref dense-matrix, \ref sparse-matrix.

## Network Matrices ##

The executable `cmr-generate-network` creates a random \f$ m \f$-by-\f$n\f$ network matrix, either ternary (default) or binary.
In order to generate a ternary matrix, it first constructs a random graphic matrix (see above) and then modifies its signs via \ref camion.
For the binary matrix, a random spanning tree is constructed and oriented to become an arborescence with root.
For the co-tree edges, only node pairs are considered, where the second node lies on the directed path from the first node to the root.
It can be called as follows, where \f$ m \f$ equals ROWS and \f$ n \f$ equals COLS.

    ./cmr-generate-network [OPTIONS] ROWS COLS

Options:
  - `-b`        Restrict to binary network matrices based on arborescences.
  - `-B NUM`    Benchmarks the recognition algorithm for the created matrix with NUM repetitions.
  - `-o FORMAT` Format of output FILE; default: `dense`.

Formats for matrices are \ref dense-matrix, \ref sparse-matrix.

## Random Matrices ##

The executable `cmr-generate-random` creates a random \f$ m \f$-by-\f$n\f$ binary matrix whose entries are chosen uniformly at random with a given probability \f$ p \f$.
It can be called as follows, where \f$ m \f$ equals ROWS and \f$ n \f$ equals COLS.

    ./cmr-generate-random [OPTIONS] ROWS COLS p

Options:
  - `-o FORMAT` Format of output FILE; default: `dense`.

Formats for matrices are \ref dense-matrix, \ref sparse-matrix.

## Random Perturbations ##

The executable `cmr-perturb-random` modifies a matrix by applying a specified number of random perturbations of different types.
It can be called as follows.

    ./cmr-perturb-random [OPTIONS] MATRIX

Options:
  - `-i FORMAT` Format of input MATRIX file; default: `dense`.
  - `-o FORMAT` Format of output matrix; default: same as input format.
  - `-0 NUM`    Turn NUM randomly chosen nonzero entries to 0s.
  - `-1 NUM`    Turn NUM randomly chosen zero entries into 1s.
  - `--1 NUM`   Turn NUM randomly chosen zero entries into -1s.
  - `-b NUM`    Flip NUM randomly chosen entries over the binary field.
  - `-t NUM`    Flip NUM randomly chosen entries over the ternary field.

If MATRIX is `-`, then the matrix will be read from stdin.
Formats for matrices are \ref dense-matrix, \ref sparse-matrix.

## Gurobi Coefficient Matrix ##

The executable `cmr-extract-gurobi` extracts the coefficient matrix of a mixed-integer program file that can be read by the [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com).
Building it requires that Gurobi is found by cmake.
To this end, you may need to set the cmake option `-DGUROBI_DIR` to your Gurobi installation directory.
It can be called as follows.

    ./cmr-extract-gurobi [OPTIONS] MIPFILE

Options:
  - `-o FORMAT` Format of output matrix; default: `dense`.

Formats for matrices are \ref dense-matrix, \ref sparse-matrix.
MIPFILE must refer to a file that Gurobi can read.
